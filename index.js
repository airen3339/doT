/* doT + auto-compilation of doT templates
 *

 * Licensed under the MIT license
 *
 * Compiles .def, .dot, .jst files found under the specified path.
 * It ignores sub-directories.
 * Template files can have multiple extensions at the same time.
 * Files with .def extension can be included in other files via {{#def.name}}
 * Files with .dot extension are compiled into functions with the same name and
 * can be accessed as renderer.filename
 * Files with .jst extension are compiled into .js files. Produced .js file can be
 * loaded as a commonJS, AMD module, or just installed into a global variable
 * (default is set to window.render).
 * All inline defines defined in the .jst file are
 * compiled into separate functions and are available via _render.filename.definename
 *
 * Basic usage:
 * var dots = require("dot").process({path: "./views"});
 * dots.mytemplate({foo:"hello world"});
 *
 * The above snippet will:
 * 1. Compile all templates in views folder (.dot, .def, .jst)
 * 2. Place .js files compiled from .jst templates into the same folder.
 *    These files can be used with require, i.e. require("./views/mytemplate").
 * 3. Return an object with functions compiled from .dot templates as its properties.
 * 4. Render mytemplate template.
